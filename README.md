## How to use

1. Execute `gradle build` on a terminal to download the project dependencies.
    > This will also execute the current test case tag.

2. Execute test cases
    * Via `gradle build` command.
    * Via runner file located at `src/test/java/runner`.
      <br> You need to update the tag in the `CucumberOptions` based on the tag of the test case to be executed.

<div style="color:#856404; background-color: #fff3cd; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    The test cases for the switch tab/window (4, 5) has changed so it's impossible to complete them.
</div>
